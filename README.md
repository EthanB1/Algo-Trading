#  Machine Learning Trading Bot
In this Challenge, I’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. My firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, my firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.The speed of these transactions gave my firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. I'm thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, I’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## Steps:
1. ### Establish baseline performance
    - #### In this section, I’ll code a preliminary framework to establish a baseline performance for the trading algorithm
2. ### Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm
    - #### In this section, I’ll tune and adjust, the model’s input features to find the parameters that result in the best trading outcomes. 
    - #### the following input features produced the best result for the trading algorithm:

3. ### Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier
    - #### In this section, I’ll use the original parameters that the starter code provided. But, I’ll apply them to the performance of a second machine learning model. 
4. ### Generate evaluation report
